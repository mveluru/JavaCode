2. Array and Matrix Interview Questions
Next to String is array, the second most frequently used data structure. Array stores element in a contiguous memory location and in C++ you can access array elements using pointer arithmetic as well, but in Java array is again an object, which provides just length method.

You can only access the array using index and Java also doesn't valid index check and if you try to access an array with an invalid index, you will get java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, so beware of that.

Here is a list of some of the frequently asked Array and Matrix-based Programming questions:
