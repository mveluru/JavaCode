4. Binary Tree Interview Questions
tree data structure is another popular data structure in programming interviews. It has several variants e.g. binary tree, binary search tree and even binary heaps. It's almost guaranteed to see a couple of binary tree questions in programming job interviews.

Here is a list of some of the popular binary tree interview questions from programming job interviews:


Implement a binary search tree?  (solution)

Pre-order traversal in given binary tree? (solution)

Traverse a given binary tree in Pre-order without recursion (solution)

Implement Post-order traversal algorithm? (solution)

Traverse a binary tree in Post order traversal without recursion (solution)

Print all leaves of a binary search tree? (solution)

Count a number of leaf nodes in given binary tree? (solution)

In order traversal in given binary tree? (solution)

Print all nodes of given binary tree using inorder traversal without recursion (solution)

Check if a given binary tree is a binary search tree?  (solution)

Check if a binary tree is balanced or not? (solution)

Given a binary search tree, how do you check whether there are two nodes in it whose sum equals a given value? (solution)

convert a binary search tree to a sorted double-linked list.you are only allowed to change the target of pointers, but cannot create any new nodes. (solution)

Given a binary search tree and a value k, How do you find a node in the binary search tree whose value is closest to k. (solution)
