1. String Interview Questions
String is probably the most used data structure. You will see it right from your programming course and you will use it throughout your professional project. There is hardly an application written in Java and C++ who doesn't use String.

They are everywhere. From C++ perspective, String is nothing but a null-terminated character array, but from Java perspective, String is full-fledged object backed by character array.

In this category, you will find questions which require String manipulations e.g. substring, reversing, searching, sorting, slicing and dicing etc.
