5. Stack and Queue Interview Questions
Stack and Queue are derived data structure i.e. they are implemented either using an array or linked list, but they have unique features.

A queue is also known as FIFO data structure, which means First In First Out i.e. the element which will be added first will also be retrieved first.

Queue allows you to add an element at the tail and retrieve an element from the head, thus giving FIFO ordering.

On the other hand, Stack is a LIFO data structure, Last In First out i.e. the element which will be added first will be the last one to go.

This property is often used to convert a recursive algorithm into an iterative one. To learn more about Stack and Queue, I just you to join a good course on Data Structure and Algorithms e.g. Deep Dive into Data Structure in Java.


For now, let's see some coding problems based on Stack and Queue data structure in Java.

1) How do you implement a Queue using two Stacks? (answer)

2) Write a Java program to implement Stack using an array and linked list? (answer)

3) How do you implement Stack using Queues? (answer)

4) Given a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values, using Stack? (answer)

5) Difference between Stack and Queue data structure (answer)
